Short definition:
- a relationship between two objects is referred as an association, 
- an association is known as composition when one object owns another object, and
- an association is known as aggregation when one object uses another object.

In the case of Composition, an object can NOT exist without being part of the main object
- Individual parts of a car can not function when a car is destroyed.
- A department in a school does not exist outside the school.

In the case of Aggregation, an object can exist without being part of the main object 
- a Player which is part of a Team, can exist without a team and can become part of other teams as well.
- when School closed, a Student still exists and then can join another School or so. 

UML Notation:
- A composition is denoted by a filled diamond, 
- An aggregation is denoted by an empty diamond, 
- This shows their obvious difference in terms of strength of the relationship.
- The composition is stronger than Aggregation.
